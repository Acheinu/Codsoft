Overview
This repository contains machine learning models for different predictions using different datasets like sales, Iris, Titanic.
The project demonstrates the application of classification and regression models where necessary to make predictions using the various datasets.

Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, cleaning, and model building.
models/: The trained machine learning models.
scripts/: Python scripts for data processing and model evaluation.
README.md: Project overview and instructions.

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-prediction.git
cd sales-prediction

Install required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Load the dataset:
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('data/name_data.csv')

Train the model: Follow the steps in the Jupyter notebooks to preprocess the data and train a regression model to predict sales.

Evaluate the model: evaluate the model using necessary metric like MAE, MSE,and R-squared for regression and accuracy_score, recall, F1 for classification tasks.
